#### There are default settings for SSO extension requests on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices<!-- 15082414-15084030 -->  

When you create a single sign-on app extension configuration profile, there are some settings you configure. The following settings will use the following default values for all SSO extension requests:

- **AppPrefixAllowList** key
  - macOS default value: `com.microsoft.,com.apple.`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `com.apple.`

- **browser_sso_interaction_enabled** key
  - macOS default value: `1`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `1`

- **disable_explicit_app_prompt** key
  - macOS default value: `1`
  - iOS/iPadOS default value: `1`

If you configure a value other than the default value, then the configured value will overwrite the default value. 

For example, you don't configure the `AppPrefixAllowList` key. By default, all Microsoft apps (`com.microsoft.`) and all Apple apps (`com.apple.`) will be enabled for SSO on macOS devices. You can overwrite this behavior by adding a different prefix to the list, such as `com.contoso.`.

For more information on the Enterprise SSO plug-in, go to [Use the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md)

### App management

#### Microsoft Store apps in Intune<!-- 12708346 -->  
You can now search, browse, configure, and deploy Microsoft Store apps within Intune. The new Microsoft Store app type is implemented using the Windows Package Manager. This app type features an expanded catalog of apps, which includes both UWP apps and Win32 apps. Roll out of this feature is expected to complete by December 2, 2022.  For more information, see [Add Microsoft Store apps to Microsoft Intune](../apps/store-apps-microsoft.md).

### Tenant administration

#### Access policies for multiple Administrator Approval (public preview)<!-- 9348867  -->
In public preview, you can use Intune *access policies* to require that a second Administrator Approval account be used to approve a change before the change is applied. This capability is known as multiple Administrator Approval (MAA).

You create an access policy to protect a type of resource, like App deployments. Each access policy also includes a group of users who are *approvers* for the changes protected by the policy. When a resource like an app deployment configuration is protected by an access policy, any changes that are made to the deployment, including creating, deleting, or modifying an existing deployment won't apply until a member of the approvers group for that access policy reviews and approves that change.

Approvers can also reject requests, and both the individual requesting a change and the approver can provide notes about the change, or why it was approved or rejected.

Access policies are supported for the following resources:

- **Apps** – Applies to [app deployments](../apps/apps-add.md), but doesn't apply to app protection policies.
- **Scripts** – Applies to deploying scripts to devices that run [macOS](../apps/macos-shell-scripts.md) or [Windows](../apps/intune-management-extension.md).

For more information, see [Use Access policies to require multiple administrative approval](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).  

### Device security

#### Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management for Android (Preview)<!-- 15769204 -->  
As a public preview, you can now use Microsoft Tunnel with unenrolled devices. This capability is called [Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-mam.md) (MAM). This preview supports Android, and without any changes to your existing Tunnel infrastructure, supports the Tunnel VPN gateway for:

- Secure access to on-premises apps and resources using modern authentication
- Single Sign On and conditional access

To use Tunnel MAM, unenrolled devices must install Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and the Company Portal. You can then use the Microsoft Intune admin center to configure the following profiles for the unenrolled devices:

- An App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Defender on devices for use as the Tunnel client app.
- A second App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Edge to connect to Tunnel.
- An App protection profile to enable automatic start of the Microsoft Tunnel connection.

Applies to:  
- Android Enterprise

### App management

#### Control the display of Managed Google Play apps<!-- 621615   -->  
You can group Managed Google Play apps into collections and control the order that collections are displayed when selecting apps in Intune. You can also make apps visible via search only. This capability is available in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **All apps** > **Add** > **Managed Google Play app**. For related information, see [Add a Managed Google Play store app directly in the Intune admin center](../apps/apps-add-android-for-work.md#add-a-managed-google-play-store-app-directly-in-the-microsoft-intune-admin-center).

### Device configuration

#### New password complexity setting for Android Enterprise 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 12436068  -->  
On Android Enterprise 11 and older personally owned devices with a work profile, you can set the following password settings:

- **Compliance policies** > **Android Enterprise for platform** > **Personally owned work profile** > **System security** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Device configuration profiles** > **Android Enterprise for platform** > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Work profile settings** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**
- **Device configuration profiles** > **Android Enterprise for platform** > **Personally owned work profile** > **Device restrictions** > **Password** > **Required password type**, **Minimum password length**

Google is deprecating the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings for Android 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile and replacing them with new password complexity requirements. For more information about this change, go to [Day zero support for Android 13](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android13).

The new **Password complexity** setting has the following options:

- **None**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may not require a password.
- **Low**: Pattern or PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked.
- **Medium**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length, alphabetic length, or alphanumeric length must be at least 4 characters.
- **High**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length must be at least 8 characters. The alphabetic or alphanumeric length must be at least 6 characters.

On Android 12+, if you currently use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings in a compliance policy or device configuration profile, then we recommend using the new **Password complexity** setting instead.

If you continue to use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings, and don't configure the **Password complexity** setting, then new devices running Android 12+ might default to the **High** password complexity.

For more information on these settings and what happens to existing devices with the deprecated settings configured, go to:

- [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile - configuration profile settings list](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md)

The reusable groups for device control profiles include a collection of settings that support managing *read*, *write*, and *execute* access for removable storage. Examples of common scenarios include:

- Prevent write and execute access to all but allow specific approved USBs
- Audit write and execute access to all but block specific unapproved USBs
- Only allow specific user groups to access specific removable storage on a shared PC

Applies to:  
- Windows 10 or later

#### Reusable groups of settings for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules (preview) <!-- 5653346, 6009541 -->  
In public preview, you can use [reusable groups of settings](../protect/reusable-settings-groups.md) that you can use with [profiles for Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md#add-reusable-settings-groups-to-profiles-for-firewall-rules). The reusable groups are collections of remote IP addresses and FQDNs that you define one time and can then use with one or more firewall rule profiles. You’ll no longer need to reconfigure the same group of IP addresses in each individual profile that might require them.

Features of the reusable settings groups include:

- Add one or more remote IP addresses.

- Add one or more FQDNs that can auto resolve to the remote IP address, or for one or more simple keywords when auto resolve for the group is off.

- Use each settings group with one or more firewall rule profiles and the different  profiles can support different access configurations for the group.

  For example, you can create two firewall rule profiles that reference the same reusable settings group and assign each profile to a different group of devices. The first profile can block access to all the remote IP addresses in the reusable settings group, while the second profile can be configured to allow access.

- Edits to a settings group that's in use are automatically applied to all Firewall Rules profiles that use that group.  

#### Attack surface reduction rule exclusions on a per-rule basis<!-- 13385644   -->  
You can now [configure per-rule exclusions for Attack surface reduction rules policies](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md#exclusions-for-attack-surface-reduction-rules). Per-rule exclusions are enabled through a new per-rule setting **ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions**.

When you create or edit attack surface reduction rule policies and change a setting that supports exclusions from the default of *Not configured* to any of the other available options, the new per-setting exclusion option becomes available. Any configurations for that settings instance of *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* will apply to only that setting.

You can continue to configure global exclusions that apply to all attack surface reduction rules on the device
by using the setting **Attack Surface Reduction Only Exclusions**.

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11

> [!NOTE]  
> ASR polices do not support merge functionality for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* and a policy conflict can result when multiple polices that configure *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* for the same device conflict. To avoid conflicts, combine the configurations for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* into a single ASR policy. We are investigating adding policy merge for *ASR Only Per Rule Exclusions* in a future update.

#### Grant apps permission to silently use certificates on Android Enterprise devices<!-- 12441244    -->  
You can now configure silent use of certificates by apps on Android Enterprise devices that enrolled as **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profile**.

This capability is available on a new **Apps** page in the certificate profile configuration workflow by setting **Certificate access** to  **Grant silently for specific apps (require user approval for other apps)**.  With this configuration, the apps you then select will silently use the certificate. All other apps continue to use the default behavior which is to require user approval.

This capability is supported for the following certificate profiles for only Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned work Profiles:

- [Derived credentials](../protect/derived-credentials.md#use-derived-credentials-for-app-authentication)
- [Imported PKCS](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-imported-certificate-profile)

### App management

#### New app types for Microsoft Intune<!-- 7210233 -->
As an admin, you will be able to create and assign two new types of Intune apps:
- **iOS/iPadOS web clip** 
- **Windows web link**

These new app types work in a similar way to the existing **web link** application type, however they apply only for their specific platform, whereas web link applications apply across all platforms. With these new app types, you can assign to groups and also use assignment filters to limit the scope of assignment. You will find this functionality in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), by selecting **Apps** > **All Apps** > **Add**.

### Device management

#### Microsoft Intune will be ending support for Windows 8.1<!-- 14740233 -->
Microsoft Intune will be ending support on October 21, 2022 for devices running Windows 8.1. After that date, technical assistance and automatic updates that help protect your devices running Windows 8.1 will no longer be available. Additionally, because the sideloading scenario for line-of-business apps is only applicable to Windows 8.1 devices, Intune will no longer support Windows 8.1 sideloading. Sideloading is installing, and then running or testing an app that isn't certified by the Microsoft Store. In Windows 10/11, "sideloading" is simply setting a device config policy to include "Trusted app installation". For more information, see [Plan for Change: Ending support for Windows 8.1](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#plan-for-change-ending-support-for-windows-81-).

#### Group member count visible in assignments<!-- 13434676 -->

There's a new setting you can configure:
- **Lock screen message**: Add a message that's shown on the device lock screen. 

When you configure the **Lock screen message**, you can also use the following device tokens to show device-specific information:
- `{{AADDeviceId}}`: Azure AD device ID
- `{{AccountId}}`: Intune tenant ID or account ID
- `{{DeviceId}}`: Intune device ID
- `{{DeviceName}}`: Intune device name
- `{{domain}}`: Domain name
- `{{EASID}}`: Exchange Active Sync ID
- `{{IMEI}}`: IMEI of the device
- `{{mail}}`: Email address of the user
- `{{MEID}}`: MEID of the device
- `{{partialUPN}}`: UPN prefix before the `@` symbol
- `{{SerialNumber}}`: Device serial number
- `{{SerialNumberLast4Digits}}`: Last four digits of the device serial number
- `{{UserId}}`: Intune user ID
- `{{UserName}}`: User name
- `{{userPrincipalName}}`: UPN of the user

> [!NOTE]
> Variables aren't validated in the UI and are case sensitive. As a result, you may see profiles saved with incorrect input. For example, if you enter `{{DeviceID}}`, instead of `{{deviceid}}` or `{{DEVICEID}}`, then the literal string is shown instead of the device's unique ID. Be sure to enter the correct information. All lowercase or all uppercase variables are supported, but not a mix.

### Device security

#### Disable use of UDP connections on your Microsoft Tunnel Gateway servers<!-- 9295335 -->

You can now disable the use of UDP by your Microsoft Tunnel Servers. When you disable use of UDP, the VPN server supports only TCP connections from tunnel clients. To support use of only TCP connections, your devices must use the generally available version of [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as the Microsoft Tunnel client app](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-migrate-app.md) as the tunnel client app.

To disable UDP, [create or edit a *Server configuration* for Microsoft Tunnel Gateway](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md#create-a-server-configuration) and select the checkbox for the new option named **Disable UDP Connections**.
